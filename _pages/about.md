Greetings, my name is Amirhossein Jebelli, i studied  naval architecture at amirkabir university of technology, my major is ship hydromechanics. I have a solid background at engineering mathematics, hydrodynamics and fluid mechanics. I can operate several engineering softwares such as MATLAB, Ansys AQWA and Ansys CFX
I’m currently developing a MATLAB GUI to help us anticipate hydrodynamic and hydrostatic performance of a merchant ship, and developing a webpage that can help students to decide which engineering software course to participate based on their interests and needs with [my partner](https://fnegari.github.io/)
I’m interested in Hydrodynamics, offshore platforms, energy saving devices and WECs, Green energies and Marine Renewable energies.



Also, if you want to make one of these pages for your own, but (like me) are not an expert in all this, I recommend [Williams' guide](https://jayrobwilliams.com/posts/2020/06/academic-website/). In the unlikely event that you want to use the exact same format as this website for your own, you can *fork the repo* from [here](https://github.com/amirhosseinjebelli/amirhosseinjebelli.github.io). At some point, you will need a quick intro to Markdown syntax, [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUBNt18RFbo) is my recommendation.
