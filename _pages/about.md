Greetings, my name is Amirhossein Jebelli, I studied  naval architecture at Amirkabir University of Technology, majoring in ship hydromechanics. I have a solid background in engineering mathematics, hydrodynamics, and fluid mechanics. I can operate several engineering software such as MATLAB, Ansys AQWA, and Ansys CFX.
I’m developing a MATLAB GUI to help us anticipate the hydrodynamic and hydrostatic performance of a merchant ship, and developing a webpage that can help students decide which engineering software course to participate in based on their interests and needs. I’m interested in Hydrodynamics, offshore platforms, energy-saving devices and WECs, Green energies, and Marine Renewable Energies.



Also, if you want to make one of these pages for your own, but (like me) are not an expert in all this, I recommend [Williams' guide](https://jayrobwilliams.com/posts/2020/06/academic-website/). In the unlikely event that you want to use the exact same format as this website for your own, you can *fork the repo* from [here](https://github.com/amirhosseinjebelli/amirhosseinjebelli.github.io). At some point, you will need a quick intro to Markdown syntax, [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUBNt18RFbo) is my recommendation.
